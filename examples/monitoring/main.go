			// the whole system, or just that particular sub-tree.

			// In case the root supervisor failures surpassess the error tolerance,

	// child in the reverse order, meaning, if the child "greeter3" was the last
	// to start, then it will be the first child that is going to be terminated.

	// Note, goroutine termination relies on the `context.Context` given in the
